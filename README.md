## What is it?
AirlineOracle is a project made for professor Hong's Advanced Database Systems (COM-390) class of
St. Joseph's College Long Island. The project was made with help from John Giorgio (SQL backend and
structure). 
## How it works?
The project replicates an Airline (we chose Delta) in which you select your date for departure
from JFK to LAX and the amount of passengers you will be taking. The project then determines your price
based off of variables such as if the day is a weekend, an American holiday, and/or if it is a day in
the summer time (June-September). The project also uses multiple regression analysis based off of
real flight data of a Delta flight from JFK to LAX (November 4th, 2019 in particular). The data was
gathered over the Fall semester of 2019 to be used for the analysis in the project. You can download the
.exe and run the program or the .jar. Either will work, but the .exe is more suggested as it's quite 
cool. This project should be ran at SJC's Long Island campus for best results as it requires a database
to properly work. If you'd like the create and inserts for the project, please contact 
me@jaredscarito.com via Email. Enjoy :)
